# Quality Enforcement Summary

This document summarizes the quality enforcement mechanisms implemented to ensure agents follow ESLint and TypeScript rules before writing code.

## 1. Quality Rules Documentation

Created `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` which provides:
- Comprehensive list of all ESLint rules with examples
- TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Common patterns and solutions
- Project-specific conventions
- Quick checklist for agents

## 2. CLAUDE.md Updates

Added quality rules section to main CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
## Code Quality Rules

**CRITICAL**: Before writing ANY code, review the quality rules to avoid failures:
- Read `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` for comprehensive ESLint and TypeScript rules
- Key rules: No `any` types, no unused variables, no `@ts-nocheck`, ES6 imports only
- Run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm lint` before marking any task complete
```

This is inherited by all worktree-specific CLAUDE.md files.

## 3. Fix Command Updates

### fix-typecheck-safe.md
Added instructions that each agent's task file includes:
- Review `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` before making changes
- Follow all TypeScript strict mode rules
- Never use `any` types - always find proper types
- Handle null/undefined cases properly
- Run tests after each fix to ensure safety

### fix-lint.md
Added instructions that each agent's task file includes:
- Instructions to review `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` before making changes
- Prohibition on using `eslint-disable` comments
- Requirement to fix one file at a time with test verification
- List of all ESLint rules that must be followed

## 4. Script Template Updates

### fix-typescript-safe
Enhanced task template with:
```markdown
## Code Quality Rules:
**IMPORTANT**: Before fixing ANY TypeScript errors, review the quality rules:
- Read `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` for comprehensive TypeScript and ESLint rules
- Key TypeScript rules:
  - NEVER use `any` type - always find proper types
  - Handle null/undefined explicitly
  - Initialize all class properties
  - Use proper type assertions for mocks
  - Follow strict mode requirements
- Test mocks should use: `jest.fn() as jest.MockedFunction<...>`
- Unknown shapes should use `unknown` with type guards, not `any`
```

### fix-lint-parallel
Enhanced task template with:
```markdown
## Code Quality Rules:
**CRITICAL**: Review quality rules BEFORE fixing any ESLint errors:
- Read `.claude/docs/quality-rules.md` for comprehensive rules
- Key ESLint rules to follow:
  - **@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any**: NEVER use `any` - find proper types
  - **@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars**: Remove or prefix with `_`
  - **@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment**: No @ts-nocheck or @ts-ignore
  - **@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports**: Use ES6 imports only
```

## 5. Benefits

1. **Prevention Over Correction**: Agents understand rules BEFORE writing code
2. **Consistent Standards**: All agents follow the same quality guidelines
3. **Reduced Iterations**: Fewer quality gate failures mean faster completion
4. **Learning Resource**: New agents can quickly understand project standards
5. **Type Safety**: Strong emphasis on avoiding `any` and proper typing

## 6. Enforcement Points

Quality rules are enforced at multiple stages:
1. **Pre-coding**: Agents read quality rules before starting
2. **During coding**: Agents reference rules while writing
3. **Post-coding**: Agents run quality checks before completion
4. **Task templates**: Include inline reminders of key rules
5. **Pipeline checks**: Quality gates catch any missed issues

## 7. Key Rules Emphasized

The most common ESLint errors in the codebase:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` (majority of errors)
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`
- `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports`

These are highlighted prominently in all documentation and templates.

## Result

With these changes, agents will:
1. Understand quality requirements upfront
2. Write compliant code from the start
3. Avoid common pitfalls
4. Reduce quality gate failures
5. Complete tasks more efficiently
