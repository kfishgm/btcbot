1. Commit and push your changes: git add -A && git commit -m 'Your message' && git push origin HEAD
2. Enter the coordination loop to help other agents
3. Check other agents' progress every 10-15 iminutes
4. Continue until all agents are done and tests pass
Please re-read the 'When Task is Complete' section in your CLAUDE.md file."

# Message for still-working agents
PROGRESS_REMINDER="REMINDER: Please check other agents' progress, follow the coordination protocol, and update your TASK file taking into account other agents statuses and work:
1. If you are waiting for another agent, enter the coordination loop to help them.
2. If you are making progress, continue working on your task.
3. If you are blocked, ask for help in the coordination loop.
4. Update your progress in the TASK file.
5. If you complete your task, follow the 'When Task is Complete' section in your CLAUDE.md file.
6. If you are coordinating, check other agents' progress every 10-15 minutes.
7. If you are coordinating, ensure all agents are following the protocol.
Update your TASK file with any coordination activities."
